					<h3 style="color:#0616BC;">What are the symptoms of COVID-19?</h3>
					<p class="text-justify">The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but donâ€™t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness. People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention.</p>

					<p class="text-justify">People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through contact with small droplets expelled from nose or mouth of COVID-19 patients via coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people may catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets directy from a person with COVID-19. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a sick person.</p>
